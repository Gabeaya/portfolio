          <p>Hello all! My name is Gabriel Ayala and I am studying to become a programmer. I have oddly found a rush from coding as well as comfort in it. With constant dedication to learn code I am eager to extend the breadth of this page. For now, welcome all and enjoy :)</p>

                <p>I created a website that contained images,text, and links. I also created a class that was named flashy which contained three html elements. I used floats, list-style-position, and text-align as the three new block elements. Html, Markdown, and Css were used.</p>

          <p>I had lived in California my entire life. With the spring of covid-19, I decided it was time for a fresh start and packed my bags to Washington. I had studied to become a mechanical engineer which soon diverted to an associates in business. Not satisfied with my decision, I dabbled in logo design for friends, family, and referals. Desiring more income, I took up a construction job and really enjoyed the fruits of hard labor. Wanting a job closer to home I decided, "Why not just work from home!" I stumbled across coding as the pay seemed lucrative, but, being I was never an amazing techie, I had always steered clear of the idea. It may be early on but I feel I have found a new home in the field of front-end programming and feel I am primed for the challenges to come.</p>
