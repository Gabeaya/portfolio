  <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Hello all! My name is Gabriel Ayala and I am studying to become a programmer. I had lived in California my entire life. With the spring of covid-19, I decided it was time for a fresh start and packed my bags to Washington. I had studied to become a mechanical engineer which quickly detered to my associates in business. Not satisfied with my decision, I dabbled in logo design for friends, family, and referals. Desiring more income, I took up a construction job and really enjoyed the fruits of hard labor. Wanting a job closer to home I decided, "Why not just work from home!" I have oddly found a rush from coding as well as comfort in it. With constant dedication to learn code I am eager to extend the breadth of this page. For now, welcome all and enjoy :)
