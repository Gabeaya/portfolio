  <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Hello all! My name is Gabriel Ayala and I am studying to become a programmer. I have oddly found a rush from coding as well as comfort in it. With constant dedication to learn code I am eager to extend the breadth of this page. For now, welcome all and enjoy :)</p>
  <h2>The Roots:<em> A little about my background</em></h2>
    <p>I had lived in California my entire life. With the spring of covid-19, I decided it was time for a fresh start and packed my bags to Washington. I had studied to become a mechanical engineer which soon diverted to an associates in business. Not satisfied with my decision, I dabbled in logo design for friends, family, and referals. Desiring more income, I took up a construction job and really enjoyed the fruits of hard labor. Wanting a job closer to home I decided, "Why not just work from home!" I stumbled across coding as the pay seemed lucrative, but, being I was never an amazing techie, I had always steered clear of the idea. It may be early on but I feel I have found a new home in the field of front-end programming and feel I am primed for the challenges to come.</p>

  <h2><strong>My Progress this far:</strong><em> A collection of my projects</em></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h3><a href="https://github.com/Gabeaya/hello-world.git">Hello World</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Gabeaya/goodbye.git">Goodbye</a></h3>
    <p>For this project, we practiced Git tracking, making Git commits, how to change to the main branch (if need be), how to make new remote repositories, and how to push our local changes to that repository. Html was used.</p> 
    </li>
    <li><h3><a href="https://github.com/Gabeaya/cookies-recipe.git">Cookies Recipe</a></h3>
    <p>We practiced Git cloning, correctly formatting the html, and pushing changes into our own repository on Github. Html was used.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h3><a href="https://github.com/Gabeaya/my-first-webpage.git">My First Webpage/Favorite Things</a></h3>
    <p>We practiced typing in our text editor, more proper formatting, using new tags, how to link a project within another, how to link images and links, and re-enforcing the adding and pushing of code. Html was used.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h3><a href="https://github.com/Gabeaya/my-goofy-newfie.git">My Goofy Newfie</a></h3>
    <p>This lesson was fairly similar to the above, but later on I learned how to make a README and added it to this project. Html and Markdown were the languages used.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h3><a href="https://github.com/Gabeaya/Chubbs-cupcakes.git">Chubbs Cupcakes</a></h3>
    <p>I created a website that contained images,text, and links. I also created a class that was named flashy which contained three html elements. I used floats, list-style-position, and text-align as the three new block elements. Html, Markdown, and Css were used.</p>
    </li>
